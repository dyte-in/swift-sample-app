### Built With

- [Dyte iOS SDK](https://docs.dyte.io/ios/installation)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org)
- [Alamofire](https://alamofire.github.io/Alamofire/)
- :heart:

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Xcode
- Cocoapods (follow official guide [here](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html))
  ```sh
  sudo gem install cocoapods
  ```
- A working backend that can connect to Dyte APIs
  - This app currently connects to our sample backend implementation (https://github.com/dyte-in/sample-app-backend), currently hosted at https://dyte-sample.herokuapp.com - this can be grepped and replaced if you want it to work with your own backend implementation

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dyte-in/swift-sample-app.git
   ```

2. Install Pods

   ```sh
   cd Dyte\ Swift\ Sample/
   pod install
   ```

3. Open `Dyte Swift Sample.xcworkspace` using Xcode

   ```sh
   open Dyte\ Swift\ Sample.xcworkspace
   ```

4. Run in simulator by pressing `⌘+R` or selecting `Run` from `Product` menu in Xcode.

5. To run on a real device, you would need to connect your device while Xcode is open. A prompt will appear on your device to trust the computer, and on accepting that Xcode would detect your device. After a few moments of wait, during which Xcode prepares your device to accept development builds, you would be able to see your device at the top of the list in the target device list in Xcode.
